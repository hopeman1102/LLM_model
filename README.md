# Chimera, democratizing ChatGPT across languages

## The phylosphy to name Chimera

The biggest barrier of LLM is that we do not have enough candidate names for LLM,  as LLAMA，Guanaco, Vicuna, and Alpaca were already used. Therefore, we find a similiar hybrid creature in Greek mythology  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology) , composed of different animal parts from Lycia and Asia Minor. This is coincidentally to memorize a peroid to play DOTA (and also Warcraft III) during high school and undergraduate time. Interestingly,  we also give a nick name for Chimera, 华驼 (litterally as a Chinese LLaMA) -- I'll give you a riddle, and you'll know why it's called that after a while.

## Motivation 

- Break  "AI supremacy"  and democratize ChatGPT
> "AI supremacy" is understood as a company's absolute leadership and monopoly position in an AI field, which may even include exclusive capabilities beyond general artificial intelligence. This is unacceptable for society and may even lead to individual influence on the direction of human future, thus bringing various hazards to society.
- Make ChatGPT-like LLM accessiable across countries and languages
- Make AI open again. Every person, regardless of their skin color or place of birth, should have equal access to the technology gifted by the creator. For example, many pioneers have made great efforts to spread the use of light bulbs and vaccines to developing countries. Similarly, ChatGPT, one of the greatest technological advancements in modern history, should also be made available to all.


## What is new in Chimera

Sorry, the short answer is
> nothing new but a hybrid like Chimera

The long answer will be shown below. Here are the modifications:

- User generated ChatGPT conversations.

### Instruction
- **User**-centered  instruction (**Modular** instruction construction)
- **Chat**-based instructions (user, instruction, conversations)
- Multilingual instructions (language-specific instructions and post-translation -- the latter makes intruction language-agostic)
