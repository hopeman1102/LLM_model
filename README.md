# Chimera, democratizing ChatGPT across languages

## The phylosphy of naming (Chimera)

The biggest barrier of LLM is that we do not have enough candidate names for LLM,  as LLAMA，Guanaco, Vicuna, and Alpaca were already used. Therefore, we find a similiar hybrid creature in Greek mythology  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology) , composed of different animal parts from Lycia and Asia Minor. This is coincidentally to memorize a peroid to play DOTA (and also Warcraft III) during high school and undergraduate time. Interestingly,  we also give a nick name for Chimera, 华驼 (litterally as a Chinese LLaMA).

## Motiation 

- Break  "AI supremacy"  and democratize ChatGPT
> "AI supremacy" is understood as a company's absolute leadership and monopoly position in an AI field, which may even include exclusive capabilities beyond general artificial intelligence. This is unacceptable for society and may even lead to individual influence on the direction of human future, thus bringing various hazards to society.
- Make ChatGPT-like LLM accessiable across countries and languages
