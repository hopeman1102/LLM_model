## ü§î Motivation

- Break  "AI supremacy"  and democratize ChatGPT

> "AI supremacy" is understood as a company's absolute leadership and monopoly position in an AI field, which may even
> include exclusive capabilities beyond general artificial intelligence. This is unacceptable for AI community and may
> even
> lead to individual influence on the direction of the human future, thus bringing various hazards to human society.

- Make ChatGPT-like LLM accessible across countries and languages
- Make AI open again. Every person, regardless of their skin color or place of birth, should have equal access to the
  technology gifted by the creator. For example, many pioneers have made great efforts to spread the use of light bulbs
  and vaccines to developing countries. Similarly, ChatGPT, one of the greatest technological advancements in modern
  history, should also be made available to all.

## üìö Data

### Instruction data

- Multilingual instructions (language-agostic instructions with post-translation)

```diff
+ Self-Instructed / Translated (Instruction, Input) in Language A
- ---(Step 1) Translation --->
+ (Instruction, Input) in Language B (B is randomly sampled w.r.t. the probability distribution of realistic languages)
- ---(Step 2) Generate--->
+ Output in Language B
```


- Language-specific instructions are manually design by ourself + self-instruction


> Check open intruction dataset in [InstructionZoo](https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/InstructionZoo).

### Conversation data

- User-generated ChatGPT conversations

```diff
+ ChatGPT conversations shared on the Internet
- ---(Step 1) Crawl--->
+ Multi-round conversation data
```

> Check open User-chatGPT conversation data in [OpenChatGPT](https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/OpenChatGPT).

| **Phoenix** | BLOOMZ | 7B | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | multi |  | 40+ |  |  | 04/08/23 |
| **Latin Phoenix (Chimera)** | LLaMA | 7/13B | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Latin |  | Latin|  |  | 04/08/23 |

The key difference in our models is that we utilize two sets of data, namely **instructions** and **conversations**, which were previously only used by Alpaca and Vicuna respectively. We believe that incorporating both types of data is essential for a recipe  to achieve a proficient language model. The rationale  is that *the **instruction** data helps to tame language  models to adhere to human instructions and fulfill their information requirements*, while *the **conversation** data facilitates the development of conversational skills in the model*. Together, these two types of data complement each other to create a more well-rounded language model.



### Chimera (LLM mainly for Latin and Cyrillic languages)

> The philosophy to name: The biggest barrier to LLM is that we do not have enough candidate names for LLMs, as LLAMA,
> Guanaco, Vicuna, and
> Alpaca have already been used, and there are no more members in the camel family. Therefore, we find a similar hybrid
> creature in Greek mythology, [Chimera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology)), composed of different Lycia
> and Asia Minor animal parts.
> Coincidentally, it is a hero/role in DOTA (and also Warcraft III). It could therefore be used to memorize a period of
> playing games overnight during high school and undergraduate time.

Due to LLaMA's license restrictions, we follow [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) to release our delta weights. To use Chimera, download the original [LLaMA weights](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama) and run the script:

```bash
python tools/apply_delta.py \
 --base /path/to/llama-7b \
 --target /output/path/to/chimera-chat-7b \
 --delta FreedomIntelligence/chimera-chat-7b-delta
```

### Phoenix (LLM across Languages)

> The second model is named **Phoenix**. In Chinese culture, the Phoenix is commonly regarded as a symbol of *the king
of birds*; as the saying goes "ÁôæÈ∏üÊúùÂá§", indicating its ability to coordinate with all birds, even if they speak
> different languages. We refer to Phoenix as the one capable of understanding and speaking hundreds of (bird)
> languages. More importantly, **Phoenix** is the totem of "the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen" (CUHKSZ); it
> goes without saying this is also for the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).

### CAMEL (Chinese And Medically Enhanced Langauge models)

> The philosophy to name: Its Chinese name is HuatuoGPT or Âçé‰ΩóGPT to commemorate the great Chinese physician named Hua
> Tuo (Âçé‰Ωó), who lived
> around 200 AC. Training is already finished; we will release it in two weeks; some efforts are needed to delopy it in
> public cloud servers in case of massive requests.

See our models in https://www.huatuogpt.cn/ (API key required) .

## üßê Evaluation and Benchmark

We provide a bilingual, multidimensional comparison across different open-source models with ours.

[//]: # (See [here]&#40;llmzoo/eval/README.md&#41; for detailed information regarding the evaluation metrics and criteria.)

### in Chinese


#### General evaluation

The pair-wise comparison of `Phoenix-inst-chat-7b` model with others.

<div align=center>
<img src="assets/comparsion_chinese.png" width = "640" alt="comparsion_chinese" align=center />
</div>

It shows that Phoenix-chat-7b achieves 85.2\% performance of ChatGPT in Chinese. It slightly underperforms Baidu-Wenxin (96.8\%) and ChatGLM-6b (94.6 \%), both are not fully open-source;  ChatGLM-6b only provides model weights without training data and details. Although Phoenix is a multilingual LLM, it achieves SOTA performance among all open-source Chinese LLMs.



### in English

## üè≠ Deployment

### Install

Run the following command to install the required packages:

```angular2html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### CLI Inference

```angular2html
python -m llmzoo.deploy.cli --model-name /path/to/weights/
```

## ü§ñ Limitations

Our goal in releasing our models is to assist our community in better replicating ChatGPT/GPT4. We are not targeting
competition with other competitors, as benchmarking models is a challenging task. Our models face similar models to
those of ChatGPT/GPT4, which include:

- Lack of common sense: our models may not always have the ability to apply common sense knowledge to situations, which
  can lead to nonsensical or inappropriate responses.

- Limited knowledge domain: our models' knowledge is based on the data it was trained on, and it may not have the
  ability to provide accurate or relevant responses outside of that domain.

- Biases: our models may have biases that reflect the biases in the data it was trained on, which can result in
  unintended consequences or unfair treatment.

- Inability to understand emotions: While our models can understand language, it may not always be able to understand
  the emotional tone behind it, which can lead to inappropriate or insensitive responses.

- Misunderstandings due to context: our models may misunderstand the context of a conversation, leading to
  misinterpretation and incorrect responses.
